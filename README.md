Data Mining with Craiglist

Craigslist has a huge amount of data in different subjects.
Not just subjects for sales but jobs, personals, discussion forums and more.
I believe this  enormous amount of information is more powerful than general sale system such as Ebay or Amazon.
Craigslist allows you to see what human desire around the world.

Craigslist do not provide any type of API to access their information so I decided to use BeautifulSoup to parse through Craigslist to gather useful informations and run data clustering to find what human wants in different cities.
